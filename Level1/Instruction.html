    <!--As well as use VS code shortcuts and Extensions to write code efficiently and fast. (Mac users, please search respective shortcut/ to know more. There is not much difference.)

**Shortcuts which I use frequently (window):**
- ctrl + d: To Duplicate Current Line.
- ctrl + Enter: To Go on next line.
- alt + up/down arrow: To Shift Current Line.
- alt + Click Where you want: To use multi cursor functionality.
- ctrl + /: To comment current code line.

**Extensions which I use frequently (window):**
- Prettier - Code formatter
- indent-rainbow by oderwat
- Auto Rename Tag by Jun Han
- Auto Close Tag by Jun Han
- Blackbox AI Code Generation, Code Chat, Code Search

*Extra Bonus Tips:*
- open settings of vscode> workspace> Files: Auto Save> Select option `afterDelay`.
- open settings of vscode> Now search `Editor: Mouse Wheel Zoom`> check that box. So, now you can zoom font in vs code using `Ctrl + Mouse Wheel`.-->
